===========

Successor to IGM2E.

What is it?
---------- 

It's an codebase for simple games written in Java with LibGDX. 
'git clone' and throw yourself into the code! 
Replace assets, code etc. easily without worrying much about handling input, block updates, the light system and so on. 
If you really want to squish the last part of customization, modify it! 

What for? 
---------- 

It's meant as codebase for simple games and people who are interrested in switching to the gamedevness of Java. 
It's NOT meant as highly complex, powerfull game engine / framework / library / codebase / ... 
It just offers what a codebase must offer. And some more. 

I've begun IGM2E as codebase for my Ludum Dare entries. IGM2E (outdated now) uses Slick2D and was really poor written. 
After some time I've stumbled upon LibGDX. I wanted to create a new codebase for further games. 

And so begun Shadow.
