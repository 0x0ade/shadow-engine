Shadow Engine pre-processes shader code in a special manner, allowing special syntaxes, for example:

#import basic_imports;
#copy shaders/default.vert;
#copy shaders/default.frag;
#setting int noise;
#setting float offset = 5.2;

#import:
Loads the content of the given .glsl file in the shaders/imports directory.
Makes maintaining of the same functions in various shaders easier (f.e. noise functions) and
thus reduces the amount of duplicate code.

#copy:
Loads the content of the given internal file (import with full paths).
Why did I even add this feature?

#setting:
Creates an uniform with the given type, name and initial value (if any).
Also adds the uniform to ShaderHelper's list of settings.

Possible syntax additions to follow.
